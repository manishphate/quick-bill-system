# QuickBill - React, Tailwind, and Vite

## üìã Project Overview

The **QuickBill** is a web application designed to help users create and manage bills efficiently. The project is being developed in two phases:
1. **Frontend (Current Phase)**: The user interface is built with **React**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and optimized with **Vite** for fast development.
2. **Full-Stack (Future Phase)**: The project will eventually be extended to include a backend to handle data persistence, user authentication, and more.

This project is currently a **frontend-only** application. In the future, we will integrate a **backend** to support user authentication and the ability to store and manage bills in a database.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend build tool that offers fast development and hot reloading.
- **(Future)** Backend: We will integrate backend technologies such as **Node.js** and **Express**, along with a database **MongoDB**, to add full-stack capabilities.

## üß© Features (Frontend)

### Current Features:
- **Bill Creation**: Users can create a bill by entering items, quantities, and prices.
- **Bill Calculation**: Automatically calculates the total bill based on the input.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive thanks to Tailwind CSS, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple UI for easy interaction with the bill creation process.

### Features to be Added (Full-Stack):
- **User Authentication**: Users will be able to sign up, log in, and manage their bills.
- **Persistent Data Storage**: The bills will be saved to a database, allowing users to view their saved bills at any time.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users will be able to create, read, update, and delete bills stored in the backend.
- **Invoice Generation**: The app will allow users to generate downloadable invoices in formats such as PDF.

## üîß Setup Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   git clone <repository-url>  
   cd frontend-quickbill

2. **Install dependencies: Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, run:**  
    npm install

3. **Run the development server: Start the Vite development server:**  
    npm run dev  
This will open the app in your default browser at http://localhost:5173.


üìÖ Project Roadmap
Frontend: Currently focused on completing the UI and basic functionality (bill creation and calculation).
Backend Integration (Future): Transition to full-stack functionality with user authentication, data storage, and CRUD operations.
